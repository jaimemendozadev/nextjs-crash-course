## React Essentials

From the [React.js Docs](https://react.dev/):

> React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.


- Component as a function: Input (props), Output (JSX)
- Hooks
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`

- Form Events
  - `onChange`
  - `onClick`

- Closures in React
  - State updates & stale values. (Show that `useState` updater function captures and updates local state: `setCount(c => c+1)`.)

- Side Effect
  - useEffect

- Rendering Lists
 - `key` attribute
 - Use of the Array map method `[].map`
